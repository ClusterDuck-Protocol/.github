## Why are We Building CDP?

In 2017 a category-5 Atlantic hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and destroyed most of the island's infrastructure. Cellular and power were disabled for an extended period of time leaving medical and communications problems long after the hurricane passed. If access to a basic communications network was available, the community could have connected with emergency services, local government, or family to mitigate some of the widespread problems resulting from this disaster.

## What is the CDP?

The ClusterDuck Protocol was created by [Project OWL] to be an easy to use mobile ad-hoc mesh network that can be accessed by people without the need to have specific hardware or pre-downloaded software (such as a mobile app). Since its creation, the vision for the [ClusterDuck Protocol] has grown beyond only servicing people in need after a hurricane towards additional use cases around earthquakes, wildfires, cellular congestion (large events), sensor networks, and more. [Project OWL] open-sourced this project so that the [ClusterDuck Protocol] could reach the communities that need it as fast as possible and continue to explore new directions.
